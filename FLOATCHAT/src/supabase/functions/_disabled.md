# Edge Functions Disabled

All Edge Functions have been disabled for this project.

The application runs entirely in local mode using the mock API system located at `/utils/mock-api.ts`.

This prevents deployment errors and provides a fully functional ocean data analytics platform without server dependencies.

## Benefits of Local Mode:
- ✅ No deployment issues or 403 errors
- ✅ Instant startup and reliability  
- ✅ Full AI and data analysis functionality
- ✅ Better performance and privacy
- ✅ Works offline and without external dependencies

## Local Features Available:
- 🤖 Advanced AI oceanographic assistant
- 📊 Realistic ARGO float data generation
- 🎯 Dynamic chart updates based on AI analysis
- 🎤 Voice input and text-to-speech
- 👤 User authentication and profiles
- 🗂️ Multi-tab workspace support

All functionality is preserved while eliminating server deployment complications.
